# AGENTS.md

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

开发票据在 GitHub Issues(仓库 `67-qingshui/Number-Sober`),发布与更新走 GitHub REST API(本机无 gh CLI,用 osxkeychain 凭据 + curl)。见 `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`。

### Triage labels

默认词汇表:`needs-triage` / `needs-info` / `ready-for-agent` / `ready-for-human` / `wontfix`。见 `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`。

### Domain docs

单上下文布局:根目录 `CONTEXT.md`(术语表)+ `docs/adr/`(架构决策)。见 `docs/agents/domain.md`。

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
